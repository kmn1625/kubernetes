That's a great choice. Ingress is the true "front door" for modern Kubernetes applications, allowing for centralized, intelligent routing and management of external traffic.

🌐 Phase 4: Ingress and Layer 7 Routing
Definition: Ingress
Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS. It gives you far more flexibility than a simple NodePort or LoadBalancer Service by enabling:

Host-based routing: Directing traffic to different services based on the URL host (e.g., app1.mydomain.com vs. app2.mydomain.com).

Path-based routing: Directing traffic to different services based on the URL path (e.g., mydomain.com/api vs. mydomain.com/web).

TLS termination: Handling SSL certificates so your application Pods don't have to.

ConfigMap: Non-Sensitive Configuration
Definition
A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-sensitive configuration data in key-value pairs. 
It is designed to hold information that is not confidential (like environment variables, flags, or non-secret configuration files).

Secret: Sensitive Configuration
Definition
A Secret is an API object used to store and manage sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, and keys. 
By default, Secrets are stored in the cluster's etcd database and are Base64 encoded, which provides a minimal obfuscation layer, but they are not encrypted at rest by default.
For true security, etcd encryption or a separate Secret management tool (like Vault) should be used.
